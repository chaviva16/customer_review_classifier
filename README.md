Customer Review Classifier 📝✨

Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Customer Review Classifier built using Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
It analyzes customer reviews and predicts whether they are Positive or Negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Features 🚀
	•	✅ Preprocesses customer reviews (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
	•	✅ SVM model trained on CountVectorized data
	•	✅ Interactive Streamlit web app for user-friendly review classification
	•	✅ Fast and efficient machine learning text classifier

Technologies Used 🛠
	•	Python – Data processing
	•	NLTK – Text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming, tokenization)
	•	Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms
	•	Streamlit – Web interface
	•	Joblib – Model and vectorizer serialization

Installation 💻

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/chaviva16/customer_review_classifier
cd customer_review_classifier

Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure your requirements.txt includes:

streamlit
nltk
